# Architecture Overview 

OpenPeru follows a layered architecture that separates data collection, storage, processing, and analysis. This keeps raw data reproducible while producing clean datasets for research and applications.

## Architecture
Our system is organized into clear layers so that scraping, transformation, storage, and product features remain decoupled.

OpenCongress uses a **two-layer database design** with separate schemas:

- **Raw layer** stores scraped congressional data exactly as collected, preserving source history and allowing recovery from source changes or improved parsers without re-scraping.
- **Processed layer** contains normalized relational models used by APIs, analytics, and downstream features.

To support efficient updates, raw models include metadata fields such as `timestamp`, `last_update`, `changed`, and `processed`. These flags allow the pipeline to detect new or modified records and reprocess only those records, rather than rebuilding the full processed database after every scraper run.

For more details, see [Data Model](./data_model.md).

### Data Ingestion and Raw Data Layer

Given that the data sources come in different formats and are updated at different intervals, we have built a data ingestion module that takes into account the unique specifications of each source and stores the extracted information as is. the data ingestion module allows us to handle HTML pages, internal APIs from the Congress website, PDFs linked to each step in the legislative process, and other historical archives while remaining resilient to format changes to the website.

As a result, all scraped content is stored in a **raw database** that closely mirrors the source documents. This preserves the original data and allows re-processing when parsing improves.

### Processing and Processed Data Layer

The processing module uses the raw data layer to process each core entity based on its specific structure. In that sense, depending on the type of scraped data, we have implemented differentiated pipeline extractions.

- HTML/XML data sources: We used `lxml` for parsing HTML and XML responses from the Congress website. / xpath and css_selector
- JSON API Responses: We used `json` and `python`'s built-ins to parse JSON type responses from the Congress website.
- PDF Documents: We used `pytesseract`, `pymupdf`, and `opencv-python` to build a text extraction pipeline from scanned PDF pages.

    Regarding OCR extraction for votes and attendance, currently assumes a fixed tabular structure, converts them to an `Image` object and runs `Tesseract OCR` on them to recover word text plus positional references at the column and row level. It iterates over lines to remove introductory text and classify pages into either ASISTENCIA (attendance) or VOTACIÓN (vote tally) based on headers. Each page contains three columns blocks record columns, which the OCR  uses as reference to parse each entry according to the following logic: the first token is interpreted as the ‘bancada’ abbreviator, the last token is interpreted as attendance status or vote (depending on the page class), and everything is interpreted as the the congressperson’s name.

    In the future, the pipeline will ideally also account for out of date votes placed via letters to the president of congress that require a standalone parsing logic.

All the processing scripts are then routed into the **processed database** to its correspondent tables by using SQLAlchemy ORM and a `Pydantic` schema validation layer.

### AI Features and Data Analysis
After the processing data layer, we already have the core entities for our system. However, there are a few features that require to add new processing layers on top of these entities. For instance, we are currently implementing two features:

- **Bill Process Summarization**: this feature converts each bill’s legislative timeline into a human-readable Spanish narrative by reading bill and step records, cleaning text, ranking key events, and generating a concise status summary. We are also adding this generated summary directly to the bills table, and it will be updated every time a new step is recorded for that bill, so the stored summary always reflects the latest legislative state.
- **Bill Difference Tracker**: this feature identifies how the text of a bill changes over the course of its lifetime. Using the date of each step of the bill and its details, we can identify when each bill was revised and changed. The raw extracted text from each document often contains unnecessary text, which requires pre-processing. For that, the bill text is scanned for key start and stop phrases (i.e. "EL CONGRESO DE LA REPÚBLICA; Ha dado la Ley siguiente:" and "COMUNIQUESE AL SEÑOR PRESIDENTE DE LA REPUBLICA PARA SU PROMULGACIÓN"). Everything between these markers are considered to be the actual bill text.
